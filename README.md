Iris Matching using Eigenvectors 

The purpose of this project is to review approaches to iris image matching and to implement a solution to the problem based on eigenvectors. The core of this approach is Singular Value Decomposition, which simplifies the structure of matrices. The project utilised Java to decompose images and match irises. The project also explored the different factors which influenced the matching process including eye colour, distance metrics and number of eigenvectors.
