PROJECT TITLE:Iris Matching using Eigenvectors
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Masters Dissertation 
VERSION or DATE: 2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:Create an instance of Run Through class and run the run through method
AUTHORS:Joe McDonald
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Create an instance of Run Through class and run the run through method. 

2. The terminal returns the resulting match for the test image for each distance

3. Test image can be changed in the runThrough method it is currently set to "001L_2.png" 001 is the iris, L = left and 2 = iris image. So this image is the first left iris image  The image can be set to 64  and there is three images. The model has been trained with 64 left eye image from image set 1. Another example could be "037L_3.png". Unfortunately the method has to be reset and ran every time which is time consuming. 

4. The number of training images can be changed by deleting some from the run through method and changing the number of images variable in the IrisMatching class. 

Additional Info:

To begin open up package.bluej 

Additional libraries may need to be directed, the .jar files are saved in the project folder.To do this open up preferences, libraries than add Jama.jar, colt.jar and concurrent.jar

If error 'out.of.memory/heapspace' occurs, BlueJ just needs to start and the project should run fine after.
